# Security Policy

this is non-production code meant only to provide an example of how react-query will interact with strings of json content. 
requires yarn serve-json (install it first)
and yarn start once youv'e installed dependencies 
alot of folks say create-react-app is (fill in the criticism of their choice), but it's a simple install to get up and running with the project.
